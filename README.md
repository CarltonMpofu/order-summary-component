## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I used this project to practice the CSS and HTML concepts I've learned so far.I looked 
forward to using the position and float CSS properties to get the desired structure.

I also learned how to use the box-shadow css property. And how to get a background image
to fill the entire browser window.

### Continued development

I am going to continue doing more challenges to improve my HTML and CSS skills further.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - Helped me 
learn how to use the box-shadow CSS property
